# TJ_route_map
This route map depicts my route from Appalachian State University in Boone, NC to Trader Joesâ€™s in winston Salem, NC. Inorder to make this map I used three separate Applications. For the BaseMap I chose a lighter map called Stadia_OSMPBright from Leaflet Providers. I then used google maps where I then copy and pasted a URL to a map on to Maps GPX to create a GPX file. I then converted the GPX file to a GeoJSON using geojson.io. The map includes a Basemap, a heading, a section that included a link to the Trader Joe's website,and map features. The map features consist of a map line, 4 place markers marking the beginning, endpoint as well as the points in the middle (Wilkesboro and Yadkinville). The map also include interactive tooltips.
